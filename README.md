# Multilingual PDF Analyzer for Adobe Hackathon Round 1A

## Overview
This project is a robust, multilingual PDF analyzer designed for the Adobe Hackathon Round 1B. It extracts structured outlines (titles, headings) from PDFs, semantically matches them to a persona/job description, and produces ranked, insight-rich JSON outputs for downstream automation or review.

## Folder Structure
```
app/
├── input/                # Place your input PDF files here
├── output/               # Extractor and analyzer outputs are saved here
├── main.py          # Extracts title and outline (H1/H2/H3) from PDFs
├── README.md             # This file
```

## How It Works
1. **main.py**
   - Extracts the document title and outline (H1/H2/H3) from each PDF in `/input`.
   - Handles multilingual content and noisy layouts.
   - Outputs a JSON per PDF in `/output` (e.g., `file01.json`).

## Usage
1. **Extract Outlines**
   - Place your PDFs in the `input/` folder.
   - Run:
     ```bash
     python extractor.py
     ```
   - This will generate one JSON per PDF in `output/`.



## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- PyMuPDF (fitz)
- pdf2image
- pytesseract
- Pillow
- numpy
- sentence-transformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)
